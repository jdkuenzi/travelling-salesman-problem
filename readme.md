# Travelling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithm

This project is a solver for the Travelling Salesman Problem using an Genetic Algorithm. In this project we are using Tournament Selection, Partially Mapped Crossover, Swap Mutation and Elitist Replacement.

This project was made during my B.Sc. at the *Haute école du paysage, d’ingénierie et d’architecture de Genève (HEPIA)* at Geneva in Switzerland.
